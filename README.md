# P1 - A Product that Solves a Problem
## P1 – Parking Lots 
### Overview

This project is part of our university’s P1 course, where we aim to identify and solve a real-world problem using technology. Our chosen focus is parking lots — specifically improving how drivers find available parking spaces efficiently.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to design and develop a solution that reduces the time and frustration spent searching for parking. The product will leverage modern technologies to provide real-time insights, smart navigation, or optimized parking management.

### Version Control

This repository is used to manage and track the development of our product using Git. It includes code, and other resources related to the project.
